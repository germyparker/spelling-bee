As a result, in English and other languages of northern Europe, words for {ldquo}window{rdquo} appear relatively late, after glass was introduced from southern Europe. In Old English, {ldquo}window{rdquo} was {it}\u0113agduru{/it}, literally {ldquo}eye-door,{rdquo} or {it}\u0113agthyrel{/it}, {ldquo}eye-hole{rdquo}\u2014since a window, like an eye, is a means of seeing out. The word {it}window{/it} itself comes from a word {it}vindauga{/it} in Old Norse (the language of the Vikings) that means literally {ldquo}wind-eye.{rdquo}"
