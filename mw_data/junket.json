In the Middle Ages this cream cheese was called {it}joncate,{/it} a derivative of Latin {it}juncus,{/it} which means {ldquo}reed{rdquo} or {ldquo}rush.{rdquo} {it}Junket{/it} was first used for cream cheese and later for a dessert made of sweetened curdled milk. In the early modern period, indeed, {it}junket{/it} was a popular term for any sweet dish. From this sense of {it}junket{/it} developed the extended sense {ldquo}a feast or banquet.{rdquo} {it}Junket{/it} came to be used for large picnics and later for any pleasure outing or trip."
