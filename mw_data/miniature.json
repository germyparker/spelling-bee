            "{it}Minium{/it} was the Latin name for a red pigment used in ancient times. In the days before printed books, this substance was used to decorate manuscripts. The Latin verb meaning to color with {it}minium{/it} was {it}miniare{/it}. In early Italian, its meaning was broadened to the point where it simply meant {ldquo}to decorate a manuscript,{rdquo} and the noun {it}miniatura{/it} was used to refer to any manuscript illustration, no matter what color. Since the illustrations in manuscripts (called illuminations) are small by comparison with most other paintings, the word {it}miniature{/it}, borrowed into English from Italian {it}miniature{/it}, came to mean any small painting, and eventually anything very small."
