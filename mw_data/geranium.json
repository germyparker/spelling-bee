            "Many of the plants of the geranium family have long, thin, pointed fruits that look a bit like the bill of a bird. The ancient Greeks thought that the fruit of the wild geranium looked like the bill of a crane, and so gave the plant the name {it}geranion{/it}, literally, {ldquo}little crane.{rdquo} The English word {it}geranium{/it} came from this Greek name."
