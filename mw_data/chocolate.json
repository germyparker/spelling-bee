            "The word {it}chocolate{/it}, like {it}chili{/it} and {it}tomato{/it}, comes from a language called Nahuatl spoken by Indigenous people in central Mexico. The Nahuatl word {it}chocol\u0101tl{/it} looks like a compound, but its parts are not known for certain, and this has led to much discussion about its origin. One interesting idea is that the real source is {it}chicol\u0101tl{/it}, a Nahuatl dialect word, made from {it}chicolli{/it}, {ldquo}hook{rdquo}\u2014here referring to the small hooked stick used to beat chocolate and hot water to a froth\u2014and {it}\u0101tl{/it}, {ldquo}liquid, water.{rdquo}"
